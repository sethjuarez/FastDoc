FastDoc
=======

Designed to be a simpler way for self documenting assemblies that use xml comments. It is still in the early stage.

## Usage ##
Download, compile, run FastDoc.exe

        FastDoc.exe Assembly.dll [Assembly.xml]
        xml optional (if ommitted will simply replace ".dll" with ".xml")
